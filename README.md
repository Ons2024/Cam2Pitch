# Cam2Pitch: Soccer Field Transformation

Cam2Pitch is a computer vision project that leverages YOLO object detection to identify and transform soccer fields in videos. The project processes video frames, detects the field, and overlays a semi-transparent pitch on top of the detected field, generating a new output video.

## Features

- **Field Detection**: Uses YOLO object detection to identify soccer fields in video frames.
- **Pitch Overlay**: Applies a semi-transparent pitch overlay on the detected field.
- **Video Processing**: Outputs a transformed video with the overlaid pitch.
